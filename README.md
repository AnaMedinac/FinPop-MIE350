## FinPop - MIE350
Collaborate here to create our MIE350 Project for Design and Analysis of Information Systems.

# Context	
Beginner level investors struggle and make avoidable mistakes in the early stages of their investment careers. FinPOP’s role is to make non-institutional investors smarter by providing them the resources needed to create smarter and well informed investments, mitigate the potential risks in investment decisions, and keeping track of their previous investments in one easily accessible place.

# Scope
The web application’s primary objective is to help the customer search through a database of a hedge fund’s portfolio using filters such as a ticker, company, or sector. All prices in the application are amounts in USD where there is a display with how many shares the hedge fund owns and the weight of the stock in the portfolio. Notably, FinPOP will solely serve as a consumer information site and will not support online stock trading. The ultimate purpose of  FinPOP is to reduce the research time for independent investors to make intelligent, optimal decisions.

Users will also be able to customize their portfolio and follow hedge funds and companies for quarterly updates. They will be able to add, remove, and alter entries from their portfolio as their investments change over time. 

# Intended Clients and/or Users
The intended users of the web application are beginner non-institutional investors who typically have little background of value investing. The application allows these beginners to become well informed investors by easing the effort of researching what prominent hedge funds are currently doing in the market. Potential clients could be big banks or small financial institutions who would have an interest in analyzing the activity of hedge funds in their region. Research into the industry will be required to further examine which organizations may be interested in this opportunity.
	
# Who are you and the team
The team is acting as a start-up that aims to fill the gap between value investing and beginner investors by summarizing hedge fund activities to non-institutionalized investors.

# What else do you think we should know
It’s important to note that after each quarter, a new data set of hedge fund activity is released by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), and thus, data must be updated quarterly. There may be a possibility of introducing a tutorial service for people who wish to learn about investing. In addition, after a few years of archiving data it could be valuable to view trends of specific quarterly data, which larger institutions may have an interest for.
